Start: 
- git clone
- cd/mtv-app
- npm install 
- npm start 


Notes: 
- node version: v10.15.3
- API KEY is not needed, I upload it to save time. I know it is not the best practice. 
- Search Functionality is changed a little bit, it will starts search after 3 characters but since there is movies that only has two characters ("It"), when user deletes search term it will be redirected to TOP 10 SCREEN. In case user typed two or one charachters and searching is already triggered it will search movies with those charachters.
